First PHP task from the Zuri Cohort II Full stack Development with PHP track

## Functions:
* It implements form processing with PHP
* Collects the Form input and returns it with the ```print_r``` function
* Next it creates a file called ```userdata.csv``` which contains the inputted values from the simple form
* If the file hasn't been created, it creates a new file called ```userdata.csv``` else you get an error like ```File already exists```
* You are now able to view the csv file from within the project directory ```./userdata.csv```
